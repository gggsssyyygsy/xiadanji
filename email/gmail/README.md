Usage
---

To initialize an account you do the following

    import gmaillib

    account = gmaillib.account('username', 'password')

To get messages from the inbox just call the use the inbox method

    account.inbox()

To get a range of messages just give the place to start from and how many to fetch

    account.inbox(start=10, amount=100)

This will fetch the 10th to the 110th message

To get the entire contents of the inbox(**note if you have a large inbox this could take a while**)

	account.get_all_messages()

You can also just get the number of messages in the inbox which is less time consuming.
	
	account.get_inbox_count()

To only get the unread messages of the inbox

	account.unread();

To send an email

	account.send(target, subject, message)

Note that the subject and message are optional.


To fetch emails with gmail search syntax. Added support for gmails web search syntax using X-GM-RAW. 

	account.filter('from:foo@bar.com')

Note that, the mailbox selection is set to Inbox(default). https://github.com/shredder12/gmaillib/blob/master/gmaillib.py#L65

Download messages by using download_attachment()
    
    message.download_attachment(location)
